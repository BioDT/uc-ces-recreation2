```{r}
library(terra)

devtools::load_all("../model")

config <- load_config()
feature_mappings <- get_feature_mappings(config)

benv <- vect("data/Shapefiles/BenVorlich/BenVorlich.shp")
#aoi <- vect("data/Shapefiles/Clackmann/Clackmann.shp")
cairngorms <- vect("data/Legacy/Legacy_Data/input/Raw_Shapefile/CairngormNP/CairngormNP.shp")
bush <- vect("data/Shapefiles/Bush/Bush.shp")
```

## Test distance calculation on a single-class layer

Start with the local path network, where there is only one layer, so it's either present or `NA`.

```{r}
path <- "data/Stage_2/FIPS_I/FIPS_I_LocalPathNetwork.tif"
raster <- rast(path) |> crop(bush)

# Check which values are present - should be 1 and NA
unique(values(raster))

plot(raster, col = c("black"))

# Buffer around all non-NA
# NOTE: cannot have a mixture of 0 and NA for absence of feature here!
# The one-hot encoding step must have set absence -> NA, or else
# We need to first do an ifel(raster == 0, NA, raster) kind of thing
buf <- buffer(raster, width = 500, background = FALSE)
plot(buf)

# NA to 0 everywhere except data
# NOTE: the masking step will ignore missing values, so we now need to to a
# whole NA->0 just so that we can mask most of them out again
# This seems wasteful!
raster <- ifel(is.na(raster), 0, raster)
plot(raster)

# 0 to NA outside buffer region
# Set values to NA wherever buf is FALSE
raster <- mask(raster, buf, maskvalues = FALSE, updatevalue = NA)
plot(raster)

# Compute distances to non-zero (i.e. 1) values wherever the value is
# currently 0, and skipping all NA values entirely
dist <- distance(raster, target = 0, exclude = NA)
plot(dist)
```

## Fewer NA/0 conversions?

This is not documented anywhere I can see (see [documentation](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/buffer.html)), but it looks like if you set `background = NA` in `terra::buffer`, the buffer gets mapped to 1, the original non-NA values get mapped to 0, and everything else gets mapped to NA.

This is precisely the trichotomous split we need, and we can easily invert the non-NA values using logical negation (`!`) or `1 - x`.

```{r}
path <- "data/Stage_2/FIPS_I/FIPS_I_LocalPathNetwork.tif"
raster <- rast(path) |> crop(bush)

buf <- buffer(raster, width = 500, background = NA)
plot(buf)

plot(1 - buf)

dist <- distance(1 - buf, target = 0, exclude = NA)
plot(dist)
```

```{r}
# No need to invert the buffer!
dist2 <- distance(buf, target = 1, exclude = NA)
print(dist2)
plot(dist2)
```

## Test on multiclass layers

Now try the cycle network, where there are multiple layers (`1`, `0`, `NA`)

```{r}
path <- "data/Stage_2/FIPS_I/FIPS_I_RoadsTracks.tif"
raster <- rast(path) |> crop(bush)

unique(values(raster))

plot(raster, col = c("black"))

# Until we reproduce the data
raster <- ifel(raster == 0, NA, raster)
plot(raster, col = c("black"))

buf <- buffer(raster, width = 500, background = NA)
plot(buf)

dist <- distance(buf, target = 1, exclude = NA)
plot(dist)
```

## Test on lakes

```{r}
path <- "data/Stage_2/Water/Water_Lakes.tif"
raster <- rast(path) |> crop(bush)

buf <- buffer(raster, width = 500, background = NA)
plot(buf)

dist <- distance(buf, target = 1, exclude = NA)
plot(dist)
```


## Test with load/save

```{r}
path <- "data/Stage_2/FIPS_I.tif"
raster_a <- rast(path) |> crop(bush) |> subset(c(1, 3))

plot(raster_a)

buffer_a <- buffer(raster_a, width = 500, background = NA)

plot(buffer_a)
```

So if we use `INT1U` (unsigned 1 byte, can represent integers [0, 255]), according to [this note](https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/writeRaster.html#note) the smallest number (0) is used to represent NA by default. Hence, the following does not work as expected:

```{r}
raster <- rast(path) |> crop(bush) |> subset(c(1, 3))
buffer(raster, width = 500, background = NA, filename = "_buffer.tif", overwrite = TRUE, datatype = "INT1U")
plot(rast("_buffer.tif"))
```

We can set NAflag explicitly, so says the documentation.

```{r}
raster <- rast(path) |> crop(bush) |> subset(c(1, 3))
buffer(raster, width = 500, background = NA, filename = "_buffer.tif", overwrite = TRUE, datatype = "INT1U", NAflag = NA)
plot(rast("_buffer.tif"))
```

But this does not seem to work.
What does work is using a _signed_ int (`INT1S`) which uses the _highest_ number as the NA.
I do not entirely know why this works and setting `NAflag` does not.

```{r}
gdal()
raster <- rast(path) |> crop(bush) |> subset(c(1, 3))
buffer(raster, width = 500, background = NA, filename = "_buffer.tif", overwrite = TRUE, datatype = "INT1S")
plot(rast("_buffer.tif"))
```
